# Ground truth guidelines

- One entry per line.
- Keep hyphenation for words split across two lines.
- If a word is split across two lines using a hyphen, ignore the hyphen.
- Index numbers are at the end of the entries.
- Keep punctuation, spelling, spacing outside of line breaks verbatim.

## Example:

From entry 2 in `kbaa-p#003.tif`:

```
