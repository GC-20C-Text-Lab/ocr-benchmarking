## logistics
- what computer: this doesn't matter if we use API, which should be sufficient for this use case

## model selection
- what model(s) -- should we use more than one?
- can you upload images to ollama: yes

## pricing
- Anticipate this will be the main barrier. How to estimate?
- is free an option? 
- - AV reminds us, Greif et al. says free works
- do results differ between free and paid?


## mcp 
- how to connect to ollama

## challenges for this data
- entries split between columns/pages 
- - is this remediable via mllm prompt or just hand correction?
- - does this mean we must do batch processing?
- track number of times this happens--how big of an issue is this?
